# Revenue-Predictions-with-Linear-Regression-
In this project, I will be using a dataset from an ice cream business. I will use this data to create a Simple Linear Regression Model. The purpose of this model is to predict the daily revenue of the business in dollars based on the temperature outside.

### Objective: 
A business owner at an ice cream shop has asked me to create a model that could predict the daily revenue in dollars based on the outside temperature (degrees Celsius). The business owner has given me a dataset labeled 'IceCreamData.csv'. 

### Steps taken in this Project:
1) Importing the necessary libraries and datasets needed.

2) Visualize the cleaned data using Seaborn and Matplotlib to generate a scatterplot that shows the relationship between our x input and y output. 

3) Create Training and Testing Datasets to train the Machine Learning Model with.

4) Use SCIKIT learn to import and train the Linear Regression Model with.

5) Visualizing trained Linear Regression Model with the line of best fit.

6) Evaluating the Performance and accuracy of the trained Linear Regression Model.
